DSPatcher is a cross-platform graphical patching tool for creating complex DSPatch circuits via a simple, intuitive user interface.

The DSPatcher project is made up of 3 parts:
* DSPatch - An object-oriented, flow-based programming library written in C++.
* QtPatcher - A generic circuit drawing library using the Qt framework.
* DSPatcher - A graphical tool for loading and routing DSPatch plugins.

DSPatch (https://github.com/MarcusTomlinson/DSPatch) is a powerful C++ flow-based programming library that allows you to create and route high performance data processing circuits.

DSPatchables (https://github.com/MarcusTomlinson/DSPatchables) is a repository for DSPatch component plugins.
